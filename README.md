## Description
As stated in the title, this project is a coding quiz. It presents a series of JavaScript related questions, which should be answered before running out of time.
 
## Installation
N/A
 
## Usage
To be able to access this website, a user needs to either click on link provided above or find it in my GitHub account under repositories. Once in it, the user will be presented with the option to start the quiz which when pressed, the first question will show, along with a countdown timer. Itâ€™s possible to access to the next question by clicking on the chosen answer whether the question is correct or incorrect, but in the latter, the timer will subtract 15 seconds from the total time. There are two ways to end the quiz: answering all the questions or getting the timer to reach 0. Also, once the page gets to the summary, the user will be able to save their score.
 
## Credits
I was able to create this code thanks to the help of the bootcamp TA and tutors, a friend who is a Full Stack Web Developer in Argentina, and old codes that were given to us as learning tools.
